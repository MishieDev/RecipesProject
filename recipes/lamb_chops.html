        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
         <ul>
            <li>5 lamb loin chops </li>
            <li> Salt and black pepper</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic minced </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme chopped </li>
          </ul>
        <h3> Instructions</h3>
          <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove loin chops from the fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking. Place them on a paper towel-lined cutting board and pat them dry with paper towels. Season well with salt and pepper.  </li>
                <li> Heat a dry 12-inch cast iron skillet* over a medium high heat. In the skillet, place the chops narrow fat side down. You probably will need to use tongs to keep them balanced and to press the chops down so that the fat renders and turns crisp and brown. It’s about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the fat has melted into the pan, lay the chops flat on one of their sides. Cook for another 3 minutes, until browned, then turn and cook on the other side.</li>
                <li>urn the heat to medium-low. Using a spoon, pour off most of the lamb fat. Then add 2 tablespoons off butter (or ghee), garlic and thyme. Stir well until the butter is foaming, and spoon the butter over the lamb for a minute or so.</li>
                <li>Place lamb chops in a serving dish and pour butter sauce on top. Enjoy!</li>
