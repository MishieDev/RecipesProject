            <p>South Africa is known for its diverse culture and remarkable cuisine, and one dish that stands out is the Skilpadjie. It is a traditional delicacy that dates back to the days of the Voortrekkers and has been passed down from one generation to another. Skilpadjie is more than just a savoury treat but an emblem of the rich culinary heritage of South Africa.</p>
        <h3>What is a skilpadjie?</h3>

            <p>Skilpadjie is an Afrikaans name for a small, oblong meat dish made from sheep or lamb liver, mixed with minced onions, herbs, and spices. The name ‘Skilpadjie’ derives from the Afrikaans word “Skilpad,” which means tortoise and is derived from the meat’s resemblance to the creature’s shape. Skilpadjies are traditionally cooked over a braai, which is a South African BBQ.</p>

        <h3>History of skilpadjies</h3>
            <p>Skilpadjies were said to have been created by the Voortrekkers, who travelled from the Cape Colony into the hinterland of South Africa, taking with them a love for meat and the need to innovate. They would preserve their meat by curing it in salt and spices – which is quite similar to how the skilpadjie is prepared. Skilpadjies became an essential part of South Africa’s food heritage, specifically in the Afrikaner community, passed down from mothers to daughters and fathers to sons.</p>
        <h3>Skilpadjie recipe: How to cook skilpadjies</h3>
        <p>To make traditional Skilpadjies, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>500g of lamb’s liver</li>
                <li>Between 16 to 20 slices of thin bacon</li>
                <li>One onion, diced finely</li>
                <li>Two tablespoons of butter</li>
                <li>One tablespoon of garlic</li>
                <li>14 g (tablespoon) of cumin</li>
                <li>14 g (tablespoon) of paprika</li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper</li>
                <li>Toothpicks for fastening</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>What to do:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Initiate the process by immersing the liver in cold water for a quarter to a third of an hour to purge excess blood and ensure a purer taste.
</li>
            <li>Transfer the liver to a paper towel or sanitary kitchen fabric to blot it dry.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a pan over medium heat and add onion, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Stir-fry these ingredients for approximately 5-7 minutes until the aromas are released.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool down.</li>
            <li>Chop the liver into pieces and blend it with the cooled onion mixture.</li>
            <li>Encase each chunk of liver with a bacon strip, using a toothpick to keep it intact.</li>
            <li>Saute over a medium flame until the bacon turns crispy and a luscious golden brown on all sides, which would typically take around 4-6 minutes – enjoy your meal!</li>
        </ol>
