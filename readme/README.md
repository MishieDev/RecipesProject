# RecipesProject
TOP project

So this is a fun little first project.
I haven't actually read all the instructions yet, so we'll see what the initial instructions are and where I intend to go from there.
For reference: Today is 10 July 2025, I am in Polokwane for stock take and therefore have time to study. We will see how long this project takes considdering I have Woodmead, CKHP and Gino's NG league next week...

So, I have completed this project. It is a week later, and I finally found the time to pull it together. 

This HTML part is still super easy.

I know it wont stay this easy.

I really enjoyed the creativity of creating my own carnivore recipes archive. I'll likely add to it in future and actually use it.
