# RecipesProject
TOP project

So this is a fun little first project.
I haven't actually read all the instructions yet, so we'll see what the initial instructions are and where I intend to go from there.
For reference: Today is 10 July 2025, I am in Polokwane for stock take and therefore have time to study. We will see how long this project takes considdering I have Woodmead, CKHP and Gino's NG league next week...
